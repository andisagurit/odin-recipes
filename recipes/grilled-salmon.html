    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Intimidated by the thought of grilling salmon at home? You really shouldn't be! It's actually quite simple (with the right recipe, of course). This top-rated grilled salmon recipe will quickly become a staple in your summertime dinner rotation. There are plenty of delicious ways to marinate fish for grilling, but we're partial to this sweet and savory salmon marinade: Salmon filets are seasoned with lemon pepper, garlic powder, and salt, then marinated in a delicious combination of the following ingredients: soy sauce, brown sugar, water, and vegetable oil. Make sure to let the filets marinate in the fridge for at least two hours to reach their full flavor potential.</p>
