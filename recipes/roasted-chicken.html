    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (3 pound) whole chicken, giblets removed</li>
            <li>salt and black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon onion powder, or to taste</li>
            <li>Â½ cup margarine, divided</li>
            <li>1 stalk celery, leaves removed</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Place chicken in a roasting pan, and season generously inside and out with salt and pepper. Sprinkle inside and out with onion powder. Place 3 tablespoons margarine in the chicken cavity. Arrange dollops of the remaining margarine around the chicken's exterior. Cut the celery into 3 or 4 pieces, and place in the chicken cavity.</li>
            <li>Bake chicken uncovered in the preheated oven until no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, about 1 hour and 15 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh, near the bone, should read 180 degrees F (82 degrees C). Remove from heat and baste with melted margarine and drippings. Cover with aluminum foil and allow to rest about 30 minutes before serving.</li>
